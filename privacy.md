## Privacy Policy

The Spot Heart skill for Alexa uses the Spotify API to fetch what you are listening to on Spotify, and to save that track in your Spotify library.

To use this skill, you need to link your Spotify account. The only permissions requested are those necessary to see the currently playing track and add it to your library. I don't see your Spotify login credentials.

No personal information is collected or stored and you can revoke access at any time from your Spotify account.
