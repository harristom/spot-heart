## Welcome

Spot Heart is an Alexa skill to ðŸ’š the currently playing track on Spotify.

The built-in Spotify functionality on Alexa is weirdly missing the ability to like or save tracks to your library. This skill fixes that. Just say:

> "Alexa, ask Spot Heart to like this"

Or, for brevity's sake:

> "Alexa, open Spot Heart"
