## Spot Heart

Spot Heart is an Alexa skill to ðŸ’š the currently playing track on Spotify.

The built-in Spotify functionality on Alexa is weirdly missing the ability to like or save tracks to your library. This skill fixes that.  When a track is playing on Spotify, just say:

> "Alexa, ask Spot Heart to like this"

Or, for brevity's sake:

> "Alexa, open Spot Heart"

### Usage

You can save tracks by saying "Alexa, ask Spot Heart to like this" or by simply opening the skill with the command "Alexa, open Spot Heart". Amazon doesn't allow skills to be triggered directly without using the skill name (except for some preferred partners). If you want to use a shorter command like "Alexa, like this", you can set up a routine to open the skill directly like so:

1. Open the Alexa app and go to "More" -> "Routines"
2. Tap the plus symbol in the top right to add a new routine
3. For the "When" event pick "Voice" and the phrase you wish to use, e.g. "like this"
4. For the "Alexa will" action go to "Skills"  -> "Your Skills" -> "Spot Heart"
5. Save
